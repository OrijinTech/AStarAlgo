# A Star Algorithm


I could not find my past project with the A* algorithm, so I will try to write a new A* from scratch.

Goal Functioanlities:
1. Adding obstacles (walls)
2. A* path finding from the start node to the target node (each node is a cell of the grid)
3. Algorithm real time visualization. (New functionality not in my past project).
